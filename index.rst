This tutorial makes you familiar with **bash**, the Linux command line.
If you have no previous experience with Unix-like systems or know a few
commands but would like to know more, this tutorial is for you.
You will learn to:

-  navigate directories
-  manipulate files
-  execute programs

.. note::

   The tutorial was prepared for Ubuntu Linux, but it works on MacOS, other Linuxes
   and on Windows-based terminals such as **Git Bash** and **WSL2** as well.
